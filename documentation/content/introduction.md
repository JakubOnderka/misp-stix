# MISP-STIX-Converter - Mapping documentation

This documentation describes how the conversion between MISP and STIX works in terms of mapping both formats together (as opposed to [the more generic description of the library itself](https://github.com/chrisr3d/MISP-STIX-Converter/blob/main/README.md), describing how to use it).  
Thus, it gives a detailed description of the inputs and outputs that are to expect depending on the type of data to convert.
